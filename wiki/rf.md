# [Radio Frequency Tooling and Instrumentation](./rf)
In the realm of security testing, these tools play a crucial role in assessing and safeguarding the integrity of wireless communication systems and devices. High-cost options provide powerful capabilities for in-depth analysis of various RF signals, allowing security professionals to identify vulnerabilities, intercept and decode wireless transmissions, and assess the robustness of communication protocols. These tools are often employed in academic and research settings for advanced RF security research. On the other hand, low-cost options are accessible solutions that aid in testing and securing more common wireless technologies, including RFID, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and various ISM band devices.
